#My First Project Band Name Generator.

#1. Create a greeting for program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.\n")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What's name of city you grew up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("what is name of pet?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your Band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
# You can also use this print("Your Band Name could be= ", city, pet)
